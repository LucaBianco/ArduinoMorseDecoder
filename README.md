# Arduino Morse Decoder
![schematic](https://www.luca-bianconi.it/projects/arduino-morse/img/oscill2.png)

## Introduction
This Arduino sketch reads analog A0 and, decodes a morse signal.
This was written for fun, and works with Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes (a videogame).

## Electrical Schematic

Components needed:
- Arduino;
- LDR (Photoresistor);
- 6.2kÎ© resistor (or other value as similar as possible to the working R range of the LDR).

## Getting Started
Please build the simple circuit in the schematic, then connect the arduino to your pc.
Next, you need to download/clone this repository, and open the sketch in the arduino IDE (note: the arduino-morse-code.ino file must be inside a folder named arduino-morse-code, for the IDE to open it correctly).
Finally upload the sketch and there you go!
